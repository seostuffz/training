## Discussion
A search engine is basically a webapp/platform that crawls/indexes site keywords/contents, extracting and ranking the keywords in relation to URL and content in the process.
Because of the unreliability of using keywords alone as a ranking parameter, Search Engines rely on backlinks and user click behaviour to assign a domain rank/domain authority to a domain as well as for specific pages in that domain.

To master SEO optimization for sites, it is necessary for a developer to use/build assistant SEO tools which can help to automate most SEO tasks.

To do basic SEO optimization, the place to start is by understanding how to use meta keywords to describe a site/pages most important information to search engines. The key things to bear in mind are the following:

 - Site/Page Meta -- keywords/description, content, social links etc
 - Site/Page URL
 - Site/Page Title
 - Site/Page Schema
 - Site Sitemap

Once these basics have been built/completed properly, a huge part of the SEO optimization task is already achieved. As a test, we will look at
some of the most popular sites in Nigeria to understand what is going on.

## Assignemnt 1
Research and document information about popular sites in Nigeria, example jiji.ng, naij.ng, jumia travels, etc. and take note of how they make use of page metas and schemas in their pages to influence/improve their search appearance/ranking.

Create and upload your observations in a gist.

## Questions
@sccofield: How do we observe the schemas?

A: View page source and search for the keyword `schema`. [Schemas](https://schema.org/) are actually a standard recommended documentation to help/guide developers in creating structured data for the Internet. Most search engines recognize and work with this.

@nel: What are we observing in the site metas?

A: Everything important, the keywords, canonical url, description, content, etc. Just go through the `<head>` section in the page source where all the meta reside.

## Tip
You can usually view page source on most browsers by pressing `CTRL + U`.
